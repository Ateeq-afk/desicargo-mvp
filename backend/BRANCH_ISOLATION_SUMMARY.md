# Branch-Level Access Control Implementation Summary

## üéØ Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed:
1. **Database Migration** (`add_branch_level_rls.sql`)
   - Created helper functions: `current_branch_id()`, `current_user_role()`, `is_admin_user()`
   - Added tenant_id to branches table
   - Implemented branch-level RLS policies for:
     - Users table (branch isolation except for admins)
     - Consignments (visible to FROM and TO branches)
     - OGPL (visible to FROM and TO branches)
     - Delivery runs (branch-specific)
     - Tracking history (follows consignment visibility)
   - Created branch access audit table
   - Added performance indexes

2. **Middleware Updates** (`tenant.middleware.ts`)
   - Extended to capture branchId from JWT
   - Sets PostgreSQL session variables:
     - `app.current_branch_id`
     - `app.current_user_role`
   - Updated TypeScript interfaces

3. **Test Framework** (`test_branch_isolation.js`)
   - Comprehensive test suite for branch isolation
   - Tests multiple roles and scenarios
   - Validates cross-branch access restrictions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Implementation:
1. **API Routes**
   - Users management routes not implemented
   - Vehicle management routes not implemented
   - Some existing routes need branch context updates

2. **Dashboard Integration**
   - Dashboard stats need to use branch-aware queries
   - Parameter binding issues with current implementation

## üìã Branch Access Rules

### Role-Based Access:
- **Superadmin**: Full access to all branches across all tenants
- **Admin**: Full access to all branches within their tenant
- **Manager/Operator/Accountant**: Access only to their assigned branch

### Data Visibility Rules:
1. **Users**: See only users in their branch (except admins)
2. **Consignments**: See if FROM branch, TO branch, or created by branch
3. **OGPL**: See if FROM branch or TO branch
4. **Delivery Runs**: See only for their branch
5. **Customers**: Shared across all branches in tenant (no isolation)
6. **Vehicles/Drivers**: Shared resources (no isolation)

## üîí Security Features

1. **Multi-Layer Security**:
   - JWT contains branch context
   - Middleware validates and sets PostgreSQL session
   - Database RLS enforces branch isolation
   - Audit logging for cross-branch access by admins

2. **Fail-Safe Design**:
   - Functions return NULL on error (deny by default)
   - RLS policies use explicit allow conditions
   - Admin access is audited

## üöß Remaining Work

### High Priority:
1. **Fix Dashboard Queries**:
   - Update to use proper parameter binding
   - Ensure branch context is applied

2. **Implement Missing Routes**:
   - `/api/users` - User management
   - `/api/vehicles` - Fleet management
   - Update existing routes to respect branch context

3. **Frontend Updates**:
   - Update UI to show branch context
   - Add branch selector for admins
   - Update dashboards for branch-specific views

### Medium Priority:
1. **Enhanced Audit Logging**:
   - Log all cross-branch operations
   - Create audit reports

2. **Branch Switching**:
   - Allow admins to switch branch context
   - Update JWT with selected branch

## üí° Key Insights

1. **RLS is Powerful**: PostgreSQL RLS provides database-level security that can't be bypassed by application bugs

2. **Context is Critical**: Setting proper session context (tenant, branch, role) enables fine-grained access control

3. **Flexibility vs Security**: Admin users need flexibility while maintaining audit trails

4. **Performance**: Proper indexes are crucial for RLS performance at scale

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Fix the dashboard query parameter binding issue
2. Implement basic user management routes for testing
3. Update consignment queries to work with branch RLS
4. Add branch context to existing API responses
5. Create branch-aware frontend components

The foundation for branch-level isolation is solid, with database-level security in place. The remaining work is primarily API integration and frontend updates.
